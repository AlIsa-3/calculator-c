# Calculator Written in C 

This calculator is written in C using only the stdio.h header.

## Features

As of this version, current features are as follows:

- Addition of Integers
- Subtraction of Integers


## Usage Examples

The compiled program can be run from the cwd as follows:

```
$ ./calculator 
Enter two numbers:
$ 4,4
Now enter the operation (+,-): 
$ +
4 + 4 = 8
```



## Requirements

As only C source code is supplied, a compiler is necessary.
