# Calculator Written in C 

This calculator is written in C using only the stdio.h header.

## Features

As of this version, current features are as follows:

- Addition of Integers
- Subtraction of Integers


## Usage Examples

The compiled program can be run from the cwd as follows:

```
$ ./calculator 
Enter two numbers:
$ 4,4
Now enter the operation (+,-): 
$ +
4 + 4 = 8
```



## Requirements

As only C source code is supplied, a compiler is necessary.

## Planned Changes:
- Function to display results
- Implementation of Multiplication and Division
- Ability to reuse the output in a new computation
- Implementation of Exponentiation

## Changelog
- calculator.c now uses 'addition' and 'subtraction' functions as opposed to one-time use code
- Created repo
